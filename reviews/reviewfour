## Details

### Game Title
New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe for Nintendo Switch

### Rating
8.3/10 Power Stars

## Summary
Princess Peach is held captive in her castle by Bowser, Bowser Jr., and the Koopalings who invade and use a giant mechanical arm to throw Mario, Luigi, and two Toads far away. Mario and friends must now travel across this new land returning to Peach's castle in order to save her. On the way, they encounter seven Koopalings each controlling their own worlds, plus Kamek, Nabbit, Bowser Jr., and many minor monsters like Goomba. By conquering them, they get closer to Peach's castle, which has been transformed into an evil reflection of Bowser.

This is a game that has the feel of the old Super Mario Wold vive with the map layout being a top down view of everything and slots to store items of later use. As for the usable items they will work for everybody exept for the crown item will only work on toadette so if are not playing her then you should just change the item out for something you can use.

As for the levels they all are fun and enjoyable to play for long periods of time, but the Boo levels might be a little tricky as you encounter them along your journey, becuase they tend to lead you around in circles till you find the weirdest way to find a door that is hidden out of sight. There are the still traditional enviourments like the desert, glass planes, water, etc..

## Final Thoughts
This game was fun and all but it was just the same game just with new characters and a new item. With a price point of $60 USD for a game that was already out just seems like an you just spent $60 on a DLC, but if you haven't played the game before then by all means its worth the money.
