# Game Review for (Tetris)

## Details

### Game Title
Tetris

### Rating
I rate this game a 10 out of 10 L looking blocks.

## Summary
Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game, originally designed and programmed by Soviet Russian game designer Alexey Pajitnov. The first playable version was completed on June 6, 1984, while he was working for the Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre of the Academy of Science of the Soviet Union in Moscow.

Tetris is an old classic game and even if you don't play games when you just hear the word Tetris you will know it's that puzzle game with the shapes being an I,J,L,O,S,T, and Z but with them being RNG for which one will spawn next will be hard to guess since you will always be wanting one piece to complete a row.

For this game you need to just like up the blocks so they will fill up the screen without having any empty spaces in between them then you win the game. This game has many other versions of the game with their own twists to it by adding a little window to show you what block will come next or putting a time limit and what not.

## Final Thoughts
For this game being one of the first puzzle games out there it has done an astonishing job. With random RNG with what shapes will come next, but you will always be looking for that line block to complete a section. So for being the first puzzle game it really hasn't done anything bad for being how simplistic it is.
