## Summary
  This game is about a hero named Link, in this timeline he has lost all memory about who he is and what he was doing locked inside of a room asleep for about 100 years. When our young hero wakes up from his long slumber he is greated with a tablet that will act as a guidence and as a stoage for memoreys that he will make and help get back memorys that he has lost.
  
  In this game you adventure though out the world and fight many monsters along the way. as you play you will slowly regain memorys from vistiing places from your past and learn what has happened when you slept for 100 years. As you vist the main towns of each region you will see different people willing to help you on your journy along the way and that are vastly diffent envioryments being on land, water, sky or lava.
  
  When you play the game you learn that every weapon has a rather low durability and will break with ease. So in return you will find out which weapon you like to use wether it be a hammer or a sword you will start hording massive amounts of weapons at a time. so in the regaurd you should not fear losing a weapon because you might find it again within your journy trying many weapons like the bow, short sword, great sword, hammer, club and even wands.
  
  In the story aspect you find out it is very shallow and you can start the game finish the tutorial zone and run staight to beat the final boss but he will be stronger if you do it this way. How ever the first time you play this you might now want to do this as you have no real idea or the mechanics of the game and will try to stick to the story as much as possible.
## Final Thoughts
What I liked about this game was that the player can choose which direction they may go and go as fast or as slow they want though out the story to find many hidden things and unlocking secret endings to the game as well. How ever what I didn't like about the game was that a good weapon breaks after about 7-8 hits and forces you to fight with somthing you might not know too well.
