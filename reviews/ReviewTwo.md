## Details

### Game Title
Risk of Rain

### Rating
I rate this game a 9 out of 10.

## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

## Final Thoughts
this game is an amazing game for being an iconic rouge like and and indie game that was made by a very few people. I will sometimes boot up the game and play one run of the game that can last for about 30mins to 2hrs.
