### Rating
I rate this game a 9 out of 10.

## Summary
Risk of Rain is an action platformer with roguelike elements. With permanent death as a primary feature, players will have to play their best to get as far as possible. Fight on a mysterious planet with randomly spawning enemies and bosses, either alone or with 3 friends in online co-op.

This game is about is about a ship that had exploded over a planet and you being a person you select comes from a drop ship are fighting your way back to the ship though out many different levels whilst aquiring many differnt skills and buff to aid you on your way back and fight the final boss the made the ship crash and releasing all these monsters.

As you play the timer keeps ticking up and making it harder and harder spawning more enemies with more health bars. whilst you look for the teleporter you can expect enemies to infinitly spawn till you progress to the next level and when you complete 4 levels you will final get to the ship where cargo full of buffs and drones that will help you take down the final boss.

## Final Thoughts
this game is an amazing game for being an iconic rouge like and and indie game that was made by a very few people. I will sometimes boot up the game and play one run of the game that can last for about 30mins to 2hrs. However when you play the game long enough you can get so stong that you can passively kill enemies and bosses without ever moving and not dying at this point you can keep running though levels again or just go to the final level and kill the boss with ease.
