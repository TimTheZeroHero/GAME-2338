# Game Review for (Guitar Hero)

## Details

### Game Title
Guitar Hero https://www.guitarhero.com/

### Rating
I rate games from 1 to 10 pizza slices and I give this game 8.5 pizza slices

## Summary
This game is about playing songs that came out round the 70's and 80's on a controller that looks like a guitar as you progress the more songs you get and the harder the songs get as well as the length. The game does have a way to change the difficulty ranging from easy to hard with changing the difficulty the game will add cords to play the cords, the cords are buttons on the controller, and are also color coated so you know what note to play as the game goes on. 

this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
