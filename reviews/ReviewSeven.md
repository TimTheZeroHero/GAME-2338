## Summary
This game is about playing songs that came out round the 70's and 80's on a controller that looks like a guitar as you progress the more songs you get and the harder the songs get as well as the length. The game does have a way to change the difficulty ranging from easy to hard with changing the difficulty the game will add cords to play the cords, the cords are buttons on the controller, and are also color coated so you know what note to play as the game goes on. 

Guitar Hero is one of the greatist games within resent times just for the replayablity it has within the community the game has fertured a way to creat your own songs as well. The DLC for the game was some characters that you can play as which they have no advantages over the others. The other DLC were songs that weren't in the game when the game first released.

This game does have different difficulty's with easy, medium and hard with each one having more notes you can play and the faster you will need to hit thoughs notes. As well you can play with friends whiles y'all try to beat each other's highscore for different songs even while you both can play on different difficulty's even though the higher difficulty will get more points but will prove much more of a challange.

## Final Thoughts
This game is fun to be played by your self or with friends whiles y'all try to beat each other's highscore for different songs even while you both can play on different difficulty's even though the higher difficulty will get more points. overall this game is an amazing game and will be remembered as an arcade game.
